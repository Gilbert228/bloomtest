         <h1> Careers</h1>
         <p>During the 2003-04 season Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.
             After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, 
             he was soon promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.
             Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen Frank Rijkaard's depleted first team during 
             the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly notes that Messi stood out in 
             first team training sessions: "He destroyed us all... Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien. </p>

            Messi began his career with FC Barcelona and stayed at the Spanish club until joining Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2021.
            After a troubled two-year stint at the French club, he signed for Major League Soccer's Inter Miami in June.
            Messi was part of the Inter Miami team that won the 2023 League Cup and the PSG team that won the 2022-23 French Super Cup. But he etched his legacy in club football during his 21-year association with Barcelona. 
            Over the course of 778 games with the club, Messi scored 672 goals, ahead of Brazil great Pele, who scored 643 goals while playing for Santos. At Barcelona, Messi leads Cesar Rodriguez, who scored 446 goals for the Spanish giants.<br>
